# OpsLogix SCOM Management Pack for Grafana Alertmanager

## Introduction: Bridging SCOM and Grafana Alerting

System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) and Grafana are each powerful monitoring solutions, but they traditionally operate in separate silos. SCOM excels at deep infrastructure monitoring (servers, OS, hardware, etc.), while Grafana (often paired with Prometheus) shines in cloud and application observability. **OpsLogix SCOM Management Pack for Grafana Alertmanager** combines the best of both worlds, enabling SCOM and Grafana to work in tandem.

With this management pack, SCOM administrators can view and manage Grafana Alertmanager alerts from within the familiar SCOM console. Grafana administrators benefit as their alerts become visible to SCOM’s centralized operations processes. The result is a more cohesive monitoring strategy where **infrastructure and application alerts live side by side**, providing a comprehensive, 360-degree view of the IT environment.

## Key Capabilities of the Management Pack

The OpsLogix Grafana Alertmanager integration pack introduces several key capabilities in SCOM:

- **Discovery of Grafana Alertmanager Instances**  
  Automatically discover and monitor one or multiple Grafana Alertmanager endpoints. Each instance becomes a managed object in SCOM, allowing you to centralize monitoring for all your Grafana servers.

- **Health Monitoring of Alertmanager**  
  Periodic API probes ensure each Alertmanager instance is healthy and reachable. Failures generate SCOM alerts so you can address connectivity or service issues proactively.

- **Alert Retrieval and Creation**  
  Active Grafana alerts are imported into SCOM in real-time. Each alert is mapped to a corresponding SCOM alert, carrying over details like alert name, severity, and description.

- **Bidirectional Alert State Synchronization**  
  Resolved or acknowledged alerts in Grafana are automatically closed in SCOM, and vice versa. This two-way sync ensures both systems reflect the same alert lifecycle and eliminates duplicate work.

- **Rich Alert Context**  
  Grafana alert details (labels, timestamps, links to dashboards) are captured in SCOM alert descriptions, giving operators full context and quick access to Grafana dashboards for deeper analysis.

## Bidirectional Integration Benefits

Integrating Grafana Alertmanager with SCOM in a bidirectional manner brings significant benefits:

- **Unified Alert Management**  
  Manage Grafana alerts using existing SCOM workflows—assignment, ticketing, annotation—without switching consoles.

- **Consistent Acknowledgment & Resolution**  
  State changes in one system (SCOM or Grafana) are mirrored in the other, ensuring everyone sees the same alert status.

- **Reduced Noise & Deduplication**  
  Leverage Alertmanager’s grouping in SCOM to avoid duplicate alerts and focus on unique incidents.

## Leveraging Existing SCOM Integrations

Once Grafana alerts flow into SCOM, you can reuse all of SCOM’s established integrations:

- **ServiceNow / ITSM**  
  Grafana-originated alerts auto-create ServiceNow incidents via your existing SCOM-to-ServiceNow connector, enabling seamless, bi-directional incident handling.

- **Notifications & Escalations**  
  Use your email, SMS, Teams, or other notification channels and escalation logic for Grafana alerts, just as you do for native SCOM alerts.

- **Automation & Remediation**  
  Trigger existing runbooks or PowerShell automation in response to Grafana alerts—no custom scripts necessary.

---

## Support for Multiple Grafana Instances

Enterprises often run multiple Grafana/Alertmanager deployments. This management pack can:

- **Discover & Monitor Multiple Instances**  
  Add any number of Alertmanager endpoints to a single SCOM environment.

- **Tag & Group Alerts by Instance**  
  Keep alerts organized per instance, while enabling an aggregated enterprise-wide view.

- **Scale Seamlessly**  
  Onboard new Grafana servers without additional SCOM infrastructure.

## 360-Degree Monitoring & Alerting View

By integrating Grafana Alertmanager into SCOM, you achieve a **complete view** of your IT stack:

- **Single Pane of Glass**  
  See hardware, OS, application, and cloud alerts side by side in the SCOM console.

- **Better Correlation**  
  Correlate infrastructure events with application metrics to pinpoint root causes faster.

- **Cross-Team Collaboration**  
  DevOps and IT operations share a common alert repository, fostering faster, more coordinated responses.
